# OS_ASSIGNMENT_K17DW
1.First question
Write a program in C which reads input CPU bursts from a the first line of a text file named as CPU_BURST.txt.
Validate the input numbers whether the numbers are positive integers or not.
Consider the numbers as CPU burst. If there are 5 positive integers in the first line of the text file then the program treat
those argument as required CPU bust for P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 process and calculate average waiting time and average turnaround time.
Consider used scheduling algorithm as SJF and same arrival time for all the processes.//
2.Second question
There are 3 student processes and 1 teacher process. Students are supposed to do their assignments and they need 3 things 
for that-pen, paper and question paper. The teacher has an infinite supply of all the three things. One students has pen, 
another has paper and another has question paper. The teacher places two things on a shared table and the student having the
third complementary thing makes the assignment and tells the teacher on completion. The teacher then places an other two things
out of the three and again the student having the third thing makes the assignment and tells the teacher on completion.
This cycle continues. WAP to synchronise the teacher and the students.
